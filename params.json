{"name":"Hope","tagline":"Higher-Order Programming Environment","body":"Higher Order Programming Environment\r\n=========\r\n\r\nThe Higher Order Programming Environment Concept\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe Higher Order Programming Environment is an architectural template for implementing end-user processes as finite automata (FA) in a \r\ndistributed computing space.  FA's inter-communicate with semanticized data, enabling the end-user to create unique and custom \r\ncomputational stacks out of FA building blocks, called \"receptors\", which self-wire based on the semantic \"interest\" of each receptor \r\nin the semantic information emitted by other receptors (similar to a pub-sub architecture.)  Applications developed in the HOPE architecture \r\nare continually emergent in that new semantic types (and therefore concrete meaning) can be created from existing data and new computational \r\nstacks can be constructed from existing and/or new receptors to work with new meaning (information.)  Unique ways of rendering information \r\ncan be immediately plugged into an existing computation stack, as rending, being just another kind of computation, is implemented as a receptor.  \r\nText-to-speech, 2D and 3D modeling, language translation, charting, these are all ways that a user can dynamically create specialized user \r\ninterfaces for their individual needs.\r\n\r\nHOPE Application Development\r\n---\r\n\r\nApplication development occurs in several tiers.  The underlying framework is open sourced, whereas receptor development can be either \r\ncontributed to the open source community or the receptor assembly sold commercially or held privately by individuals or corporations for their \r\nproprietary use.  The framework and receptors are developed in the traditional software development process with programmers.  Conversely, \r\nmany HOPE application stacks can be implemented by users with little training, although complex stacks often utilize specialized application \r\nstack consultants.  Being an open architecture, the end-user can also contract or hire in-house receptor developers, either for commercial \r\npurposes or for propriety in-house algorithms.  Regardless, all communities can draw on the growing number of open-source receptors either \r\nto use directly or to customize for their own purposes.\r\n\r\nHOPE Receptors\r\n---\r\n\r\nReceptors are semantic finite automata.  As in a pub-sub architecture, receptors inform a broker of semantic data in which the \r\nreceptor has interest.  Semantic information that is published by a receptor is automatically distributed to subscribing receptors.  \r\nHowever, the receptor can qualify acceptance of the information using non-static filters (dynamic filtering allows receptors to adjust for \r\noverall internal and external system state.)  Furthermore, the broker can \"emit\" sub-components of a semantic structure to interested \r\nsubscriber receptors when the sub-component is itself semantic (as opposed to a native computer type.)  This enables unique computational stacks \r\non semantic subsets without having to specifically break apart the semantic structure into its components. \r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n----\r\n\r\n* An APOD website scraper applet:\r\n\r\n![APOD Viewer](http://www.codeproject.com/KB/cs/781135/M33.png)\r\n\r\n* Membrane Computing (release 6-9-2014):\r\n\r\n![Membrane Computing](https://marcclifton.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/membranes.png)\r\n\r\n* Natural Language Processing of RSS Feeds\r\n\r\n![NLP](http://www.codeproject.com/KB/cs/797457/filter3.png)\r\n\r\nDemos\r\n----\r\n\r\nWatch the videos:\r\n\r\n - [Introduction]\r\n - [An APOD Website Scraper]\r\n - [Membrane Computing Video]\r\n - [Hunt the Wumpus Video]\r\n\r\nFor Programmers\r\n----\r\n\r\nRead the articles:\r\n\r\n - [Introductory Article]\r\n - [APOD Scraper Article] \r\n - [Hunt the Wumpus]\r\n - [Semantic Web and Natural Language Processing]\r\n\r\nTo Contribute\r\n----\r\n\r\nWe are actively looking for developers interested in:\r\n\r\n1.
