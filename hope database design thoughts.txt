RSSFeedName			Table, because it's the ST is identified as unique/normalized in RSSFeedItem
	Text-Value

Url				Table
	Value	

RSSFeedItem			Table, because it's an ST
	FK_RSSFeedName		Normalized, m:1, therefore the column is an FK directly to RSSFeedName
	RSSFeedTitle		no normalized/unique flag
	FK_Url			Unique, 1:1, therefore the column is an FK the the table Url
	RSSFeedDescription	no normalized/unique flag
	RSSFeedPubDate		no normalized/unique flag

Questions:

What about these sub-tree components like:

	Text.Value
	Url.Value

vs. items like:

	RSSFeedPubDate.Value

What about the fact that RSSFeedUrl is a specific semantic type of Url, which itself is a semantic type having a value?

Do we create a table called RSSFeedUrl with an FK to a table called Url?  That seems silly, but should it actually 
be a universal rule?

That would mean we would tables like this:

RSSFeedItem
	FK_RSSFeedName_ID
	FK_RSSFeedTitle_ID
	FK_RSSFeedUrl_ID
	FK_RSSFeedDescription_ID
	FK_RSSFeedPubDate_ID

RSSFeedName
	FK_Text_ID

RSSFeedTitle
	FK_Text_ID

RSSFeedDescription
	FK_Text_ID

RSSFeedUrl
	FK_Url_ID

RSSFeedPubDate
	Value

Text
	Value

Url
	Value

This would actually make a whole lot of sense because any ST could be instantiated at any level, and interestingly,
doing it this way always creates m:1 relationships (many parent instances with 1 child instance per FK).

From the ST schema, we can determine, for example, all the tables referencing Url, and so forth, up the tree to the root
node -- each ST that includes Url somewhere in the hierarchy.  

We still flag ST's with unique/normalized because this guides the DB engine in determining whether or not to first query
the table for an existing record.

Interestingly, this also means that any fully qualified named ST value can be persisted (for example, RSSFeedName.Text.Value)
and all the ID's are accumulated to create the RSSFeedItem.

This kind of architecture leads to very thin tables, and tables higher up in the food chain are almost always FK's.

In this architecture:

1. Every table represents a semantic type
2. Every FK references a child semantic type
3. Every non-FK field is a native type

Rather than indicating that an ST is "unique" or "indexed", I am going to use the concept "normalized" to represent 
that the values in the table are guaranteed unique.  This instructs the persistence object to check for the existence
of the "unique key" consisting of the native type(s) in the ST.

But where to we put the "normalized" flag?  This would be on any ST that contains an NT.
Tables which FK to a normalized (UQ) table are not necessarily UQ themselves unless indicated.

Tables that are purely FK's cannot be cached for normalization performance.

---------------------------

A very interesting thing happens when I looked at how to persist semantic data:

The semantic types themselves become tables
The structure of a semantic type is persisted through the use of foreign keys
You often get tables that are actually nothing more than containers for FK's
The "bottom" tables are the ones that actually persist the native types and have non-FK fields.

This is completely orthogonal to the usual database architecture.  Let me illustrate:

Here's what a typical non-normalized schema might look like for managing items in an RSS Feed:

RSSFeedItem
	ID
	FeedName
	FeedTitle
	FeedUrl
	FeedDescription
	FeedPubDate

If we want to normalize this, we can break this up into two tables:

RSSFeed
	ID
	FeedName
	RSSUrl

RSSFeedItem
	ID
	RSSFeed_ID
	FeedTitle
	FeedUrl
	FeedDescription
	FeedPubDate

Contrast this with the "semantic" table structure illustrated earlier.

-----------------

How to handle UI specificity? An example will illustrate the issue, and how it leads into dealing with non-UI issues as well:

I have an RSSFeed with feed items, and I want to display the last 40 (some arbitrary number) feeds from the database and also
merge in new feeds. 

By merge, I mean: if the feed item is already in the view, don't display a second, identical, record

I also want to indicate which feeds are new (coming from the feed reader), which fields are old (coming from the database), and which feeds I've read.

We need a UI semantic type, something like:

FeedItemUserState
	RSSFeedItem
	State (old, new, read)

1. The first question is, how do we query the database?  An example syntax might be:

"select top 40 RSSFeedItem where RSSFeed.FeedName='Code Project' order by RSSPubDate desc"

OK, that's not bad, I don't see any implementation problems with the DB service figuring out the tables needed to execute this query.

2. Next, how does the UI determine how to merge fields?  Well, it can determine that there are unique keys (i.e., normalized values), which in our case are:

RSSFeedName
RSSFeedUrl

Technically, only RSSFeedUrl is needed, but the merge function, being somewhat dumb, will probably end up using both fields.

3. OK, that doesn't sound bad, but I wonder, should this be part of the UI behavior, or should we have an "unique record aggregator" receptor that takes data from
different streams and ensures their uniqueness (as in, it only emits unique records?)

That seems like a good idea, as this kind of behavior will probably be desired in many places.

4. Now, how do we include the user state for each feed?  Well, the query would be changed to look something like this:

"select top 40 (RSSFeedItem, FeedItemUserState) where RSSFeed.FeedName='Code Project' order by RSSPubDate desc"

or (because State is a poor semantic description):

FeedItemUserState
	RSSFeedItem
	UserVisitedUrlState (old, new, read)

"select top 40 (RSSFeedItem, UserVisitedUrlState) where RSSFeed.FeedName='Code Project' order by RSSPubDate desc"

But this will create a semantic type that is undefined, as the tree now includes a branch (probably under RSSFeedItem) that includes State.  

Also note the (), which I'm intending to indicate: get the top 40 RSSFeedItem records joined with the UserVisitedUrlState for each record.
The query does make a certain kind of sense, in that FeedItemUserState can be acquired from the Url unique key shared in the linkage.

*** Is there a better way to do this? ***

A. In the above description for FeedItemUserState, would it be better to define it this way (especially given the semantic name for the state):

UrlUserState
	Url
	UrlVisitedState (old, new, read)

After all, the state corresponds more to whether the user has visited the URL, not the feed item.  We should look briefly also at including a user id in case we are running this on a network with multiple users:

UserUrlVisitedState
	User
	Url
	UrlVisitedState (old, new, read)

Now the query would look like:

"select top 40 (RSSFeedItem, UrlVisitedState) where RSSFeed.FeedName='Code Project' and User.ID='123' order by RSSPubDate desc"

Note the semantics here though -- we have some really abstract concepts like "UserUrlVisitedState" which have child ST's that are a decomposition of the parent ST name.  Interesting.

Also note that because User and Url are normalized, these entries will be unique for a unique user-url key.

Also, technically, the query might be better like this:

"select top 40 (RSSFeedItem, UserUrlVisitedState) where RSSFeed.FeedName='Code Project' and User.ID='123' order by RSSPubDate desc"

because it creates the full type UserUrlVisitedState which becomes easier to work with in terms of updating and persistence.

Now that we have that cleared up:

B. I don't want to have to create an ST for every kind of joined data structure I might need.  This is an important issue...

B1. We need to determine where "UrlVisitedState" goes in the semantic tree.  Does it become a native type of the Url ST?  Does it become a native type of the RSSFeedItem ST that we are "joining" with?  Does it actually matter?  Not really.  Joined types (ST or NT) can be added to the root type.  If it's a collection, then the records will appear as a native type List<someType>.  Also, deciding that the joined types always are added to the definition of the root type makes it clear as to where the additional data can be found.

So, the first order of business is the reality that new types are going to be defined and created by receptors.  Let's assume these are going to be named by the user for now (so we don't have to come up with some naming scheme) so the query now would read:

"select top 40 (RSSFeedItem, UserUrlVisitedState) as UserFeedItem where RSSFeed.FeedName='Code Project' and User.ID='123' order by RSSPubDate desc"

where the "as..." part is required whenever joining two or more ST's.

5. How to implement the display logic?  I hate hard-coding this stuff, but the only alternative seems to be a rather specific configuration UI and
behavior on the part of the list viewer.

*** Is there a more generic way to do this? ***

6. How does the UI persist state change?  Again, this points to a solution-specific receptor (at least one that is specific to having state information that affects row colorization.)

7. How do we get session information, like the user ID, into receptors?  Or, to put it another way, how do receptors access session information?

8. Does the aggregator update the state to "old", or does the UI receptor do this?  What does "old" mean anyways?  Do we want to see feed items as "new" for a while before they become "old" ?  Or does "old" correspond to the age of the feed item itself, such that, say, feed items older than two days are marked as "old"?  Should a feed be marked as old only when the user says so?  Some of this is UI aspects, some of it might be how we automate the concepts of "new" and "old" in the aggregator or other places.  Are there (at least) two different concepts of "old": old, as in, say, the pub date is more than 48 hours, and "old" as in "since the list was displayed?"  I sort of like that idea, as I can see truly new items, and after a designated time, non-new items that have "aged", or "grown stale" are indicated differently.
