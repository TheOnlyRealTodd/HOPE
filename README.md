Higher Order Programming Environment
=========

What is the Higher Order Programming Environment?

Hope is a "surface" enabling end-users to create user-specific applications from "receptor" components.

Typical applications have a limited surface area of functionality / behavior  -- in other words, applications are frequently very monolithic.  The user can only "extend" behavior by going outside of the application, either to the cloud or another desktop application.

Conversely, the Higher Order Programming Environment provides a dynamic, runtime, adaptive surface.  "Rreceptors" provide specific behaviors with which other receptors interact via "carriers" of information.  By "dropping" a customized configuration of receptors onto the surface, the end-user can create a behavior tailored specifically to his/her needs.  This behavior can be altered on-the-fly by introducing new receptors, removing existing ones, or re-organizing interactions within "membranes."

To Contribute
----

We are actively looking for developers interested in:

1. Expanding our library of receptors.  Some ideas: Email "reader", stock quotes reader, news feed, etc.
2. Porting HOPE to a web application supporting both desktop and mobile devices
3. Improving on visualizations
4. Developing applets from receptors

Marketing / Funding
----

We are actively seeking to create interest in a variety of markets, including education, finance, presentation, and information management.  We are also seeking investors for both the open source implementation and in the development of the commercial, revenue-generating arm.

Workshops / Training Tools
----

Workshops will be schelued and specific training tools will available after the initial development cycle is complete.
