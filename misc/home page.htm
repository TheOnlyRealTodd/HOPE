<p>Higher Order Programming Environment</p>
<h2>What is HOPE?</h2>
<p>HOPE is an application development system.&nbsp; Similar to LEGO's, users 
(both programmers and non-programmers) build tailored applications from smaller, 
self-connecting components (called receptors) by &quot;snapping&quot; them onto a 
graphical virtual surface--no coding is required.&nbsp; Receptors perform the 
functions of:</p>
<ul>
	<li>acquiring data from external sources (such as a stock ticker web 
	service)</li>
	<li>processing the data</li>
	<li>&quot;visualizing&quot; the raw or processed data (text, graphically, speech, 
	notifications, alerts, etc.)</li>
	<li>data storage / retrieval</li>
</ul>
<p>A HOPE application is built by selecting the desired receptors and 
configuring them (again no coding is required) based on the user's data source 
needs, processing, storage, and visualizations.&nbsp; </p>
<h2>Examples</h2>
<p>A weather service is an easily understood example.&nbsp; As you view each 
example, consider how these same principles might be applied to your particular 
data processing requirements, be they tracking posts on Twitter for product 
feedback, performing Natural Language Processing on news feeds (we already 
interface with AlchemyAPI and Semantria), analyzing stock trends, etc., <i>
tailored for individual requirements within your company.</i></p>
<p>John would like to have the daily weather report displayed as text when he 
fires up his HOPE system in the morning:</p>
<p>Marci however prefers to have her weather report read to her using text to 
speech synthesis:</p>
<p>Rachel only wants to be alerted if there are weather hazards in her area:</p>
<p>Lastly, Bill is interested in an aggregating plot of the day's low and high 
temperatures:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Why should I use HOPE?</h2>
<p>The most common use-case for HOPE is real-time analysis and visualizations 
for data streams such as stock prices, social media posts, transactions, 
traffic, RSS feeds, weather, and so forth. </p>
<h2>Key Features:</h2>
<p>A key feature of HOPE is its adaptability.&nbsp; HOPE enables users to:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Incorporate new data sources into existing analysis applications</li>
	<li>Plug in new visualizations and apply them immediately to existing data 
	sources</li>
	<li>Distribute analysis workloads seamlessly and securely across networks</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Currently Supported Platforms</h2>
<p>Windows 7/8</p>
<h3>Future Platforms</h3>
<p>Cloud-based - how can it be cloud-based when the code has to execute at the 
server?&nbsp; Or can the code execute on the client (javascript???)</p>
<h2>Active Development</h2>
<p>The initial release of HOPE version 1.0 (planned for Q1 2015) is currently 
under active development.</p>
<h2>Get Involved</h2>
<p>Interested?&nbsp; Want to get involved more?&nbsp; Just want to keep abreast 
of HOPE development?&nbsp; Read on...</p>
<h3>Investors</h3>
<p>HOPE participates in both the open source community and in commercial product 
development.&nbsp; The HOPE core is open source, as are many of the free 
component &quot;receptors.&quot;&nbsp; Proprietary receptor components constitute the 
commercial &quot;for profit&quot; arm of HOPE.</p>
<h3>Marketing</h3>
<p>We are actively seeking people who have an interest in communicating HOPE's 
unique capabilities to others.&nbsp; If you know of someone with a need that you 
think HOPE can fill, please contact us.</p>
<h3>Users</h3>
<p>Does the HOPE architecture solve a problem for you?&nbsp; If so, we would 
love to hear from you and learn about how you plan to use HOPE.&nbsp; Let us 
help with your data processing requirements!</p>
<h3>Developers</h3>
<p>We are actively seeking developers interested in:</p>
<ul>
	<li>contributing to the HOPE core</li>
	<li>writing receptors</li>
	<li>implementing HOPE on other platforms</li>
</ul>
<h2>Training and Consulting Services</h2>
<h3>Training</h3>
<p>Want to be train your team in HOPE system application building?&nbsp; Want to 
learn more about HOPE internals?&nbsp; We provide seminars for both users and 
developers, please contact us for on-site or virtual training.</p>
<h3>Consulting</h3>
<p>Need proprietary in-house receptor components developed for your data 
analysis needs?&nbsp; Contact us for a free estimate.</p>
