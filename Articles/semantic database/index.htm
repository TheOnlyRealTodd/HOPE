<p>Semantic Database - Concepts, Design, Implementation</p>
<h2>Preface</h2>
<h3>Semantics</h3>
<p>Semantics is an emerging &quot;space&quot; of research and development in computer 
science.&nbsp; You have most likely heard of the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web">Semantic Web</a> and perhaps 
have looked at (or are already working with) technologies such as the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework">Resource 
Description Format</a> (RDF) and/or the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Ontology_Language">Web Ontology 
Language</a> (OWL).&nbsp; </p>
<p>If not, you are most likely wondering, what is the point of all of this?&nbsp; 
A good description of why semantics is important comes from the
<a href="http://www.schema.org/">schema.org</a>:</p>
<p><i>&quot;Many sites are generated from structured data, which is often stored in 
databases. When this data is formatted into HTML, it becomes very difficult to 
recover the original structured data. Many applications, especially search 
engines, can benefit greatly from direct access to this structured data.&quot;</i></p>
<p>In other words, by exposing the semantics of the data, machines can then 
utilize the information in more interesting ways than just storing it or 
displaying it.&nbsp; A classic example is a website that contains a phone 
number.&nbsp; If the phone number is has a semantic tag, then your smart phone 
can easily offer it up as number to dial.&nbsp; Contrast this with the hoops an 
application has to go through to scan a page and find text that matches any 
number of styles of presenting a phone number, validating that it is actually a 
number rather than a math expression that looks like &quot;619-251-1212&quot;, etc.</p>
<h3>Structured Data</h3>
<p>In the above quote, you'll notice the phrase &quot;<i>recover the original 
structured data.</i>&quot;&nbsp; This implies that the data has structure -- it's not 
just a field, but the fields mean something and can have sub-structures -- in 
other words, the structured data is a tree.</p>
<p>Here's a couple examples:</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This article looks at a specific design of a semantic database and its 
initial implementation.</p>
