Configuration UI:
	OK and Cancel buttons need to be mapped to Return and Esc keys
	Protocol picker UI's:
		Use a combobox with auto-completion ability.

Receptors
	With grids
		Need ability to clear the contents
		Need to inspect UK's in the NT's and update existing rows
		Green and white striping of alternate rows would improve the presentation.

Save the viewer's offset along with the applet.
	
Carrier List Viewer:																							 
	Need Ordinality in schema ST's and NT's (order first by ST's, then NT's within each ST) for defining the default ordering of columns
	Persist column sort options and columns sizing

Bugs:
	The alias of a semantic type's child semantic element isn't sticking.  For example: RSSFeedAuthors -> Text, Text is aliased to authors but shows up as "Text" in the list viewer.


Semantic Database:
	ST names with spaces need to be replaced with "-"																		  
	NT names with spaces need to be replaced with "-"
	Other issues with naming?  
		Names that are keywords or other reserved tokens

	NT updating when UK record exists
	
	Query prefix (like "top 40")
	Query where clause
