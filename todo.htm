<p>Feed Reader should check if the feed item is new rather than posting every 
item in the syndication class as &quot;here, do something with this.&quot;</p>
<p>NLP Viewer:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; needs to update when a new feed item is processed by Alchemy.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; should be tabbed? to show keywords, concepts, and entities<br>
<br>
Feed Item List should colorize &quot;new feed items&quot; and feed items that have been 
read (double-clicked)&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;New&quot; is considered what? A new item(s) are new items when the feed reader is 
triggered<br>
<br>
When selecting an item (single click or arrow keys) in the Feed Item List, show 
phrases for that item<br>
<br>
Get Timer wired up.<br>
<br>
Show new phrases in newly processed feeds.<br>
<br>
Search phrases vs. Show all<br>
<br>
NLP Viewer can respond to a URL message and show the filtered phrases for that 
URL. However, this will interact poorly when double-clicking on <br>
a phrase in the NLP Viewer.<br>
<br>
The Feed Item List attached to the Feed Reader should always show the current 
feed items.<br>
<br>
Need to be able to configure the feed for the Feed Reader. Single item? List?<br>
<br>
Async Alchemy calls.<br>
<br>
Questions:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How do we deal with multiple feeds?<br>
<br>
Bugs:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; counts are possibly wrong<br>
<strike>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; duplicate entries appear in the Feed Item List when 
selecting a non-1 phrase</strike><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the &quot;topmost&quot; issue and &quot;focus&quot; issue when mousing over the 
visualizer.<br>
